 Consider the following randomized algorithm to ﬁnd the median in an input array A[1,...,n] of distinct integers, where n is odd.
 Med(A[1,...,n]) 
 1 S ←∅ 
 2 while true do 
 3 i ← uniform choice from {1,...,n}\S 
 4 Check if A[i] is the median 
 5 if yes then return A[i] 
 6 S ← S ∪{i}
Empirically conﬁrm your analytical solution to Algorithm above via a python program. 
More speciﬁcally, ﬁrst implement the above algorithm Med, but include in it the ability to record the number of executations of Line (3) using a counter variable. 
On each input, which is a list of an odd number of distinct integers, invoke Med 100 times, and compute the average number of executions of Line (3) across the 100 invocations of Med. 
That is to be your return value from the method avgtrials.
